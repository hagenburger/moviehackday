        Movie Hack Day 2011
      </h1>The <a href="http://twitter.com/moviehackday">@moviehackday</a> is a full weekend of hacking on all things movies. Anything from building your own recommender system, using existing software like Mahout to create cool new applications or throwing together a couple of movie APIs and making the next killer app. And everybody loves fancy data visualizations, right?

      <p>
        It takes place on the weekend before the berlinbuzzwords in the offices of moviepilot, a movie recommendation startup based in Berlin. We’ll be hacking Saturday, Saturnight and through the whole Sunday (beer and pizza will be supplied). We might also watch a movie or two.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this event is having fun and making stuff, so there’s two types of registrations: hacker and slacker. In order to make stuff, hacking is required. Therefore Saturday and Sunday is hackers only, so if you register as a hacker, you got to code! If you don’t want to get your hands dirty and just watch, however, sign up as a slacker and check out the demo session on Sunday.
      </p>
      <p>
        As there’s very limited seats available: only sign up if you really plan to come.
